The course is targeted primarily towards students who have completed at least one year of graduate work. Preference will be given to those planning to pursue a PhD. Throughout the course, students will be instructed on how to prepare a complete grant application package on a topic that is different from their graduate project. The proposal will be prepared in stages and completed two weeks prior to the end of the semester. Students will then prepare and give presentations for a mock site visit by the funding agency. Students will also participate in a mock peer review committee and make final funding decisions. Enrolment is limited, and registration is by permission of the Department."
